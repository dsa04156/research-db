## 요약·초록

## Key Changes This minor release does not introduce a known breaking SDK behavior change. The minor version bump is for the new provider-neutral testing APIs and the OpenAI Python v3 compatibility update. ### Highlights: - Added `agents.testing`, `agents.realtime.testing`, and `agents.voice.testing` utilities for deterministic Agent, Sandbox, Realtime, and Voice workflow tests without provider requests. - Updated OpenAI provider compatibility to `openai>=3.0.0,<4`, including HTTPX2-aware request, response, transport, and exception handling. - Hardened RunState interruption snapshots, recursive agent-tool approvals, max-turn finalization, streaming cleanup, and sensitive-error redaction. - Improved MCP lifecycle snapshot isolation and added configurable retry backoff ceilings. - Added Sandbox Runloop existing-secret support and tightened view-image path grants. - Added stricter Voice validation for invalid channels, frame rates, incomplete multichannel frames, and non-finite audio rates. ##

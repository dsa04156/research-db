## 요약·초록

## Key Changes Version 0.22.0 is a minor release because it adds substantial runtime hardening and tightens an existing provider configuration contract. Applications that combine an explicit `openai_client` with `organization` or `project` must move those values to the `AsyncOpenAI` client. ### Highlights: - Redacts terminal function-tool output rejected by agent output guardrails from replayable and persisted SDK state. - Raises `ModelBehaviorError` for non-streaming Responses with terminal status `failed` or `incomplete`. - Rejects conflicting provider options when `OpenAIProvider` receives an explicit client. - Isolates usage accounting between independent `RunState` checkpoints while preserving nested-agent aggregation. - Expands agents registered through `handoff(agent)` in generated graphs. - Clarifies the existing shallow-copy behavior of `Agent.clone()` and `RealtimeAgent.clone()`. ## What's Changed * fix(core): redact blocked tool outputs from replay state by @seratch in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4507 * fix(core): reject ignored explicit-client options for OpenAIProvider by @sylvesterkaczmarek in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4497 * fix(core): preserve Griffe logger inheritance by @sylvesterkaczmarek in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4494 * fix(core): reject terminal failed/incomplete responses in non-streaming get_response by @weike-zhang in https://github.* * fix(core): isolate usage between RunState checkpoints by @chiruu12 in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4479 fix(sandbox): require apply_patch update hunks by @li2631026381-alt in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4470 * fix(sandbox): enforce Windows mypy compatibility by @seratch in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4499 * fix(tracing): respect model-data logging redaction for record_model_error_on_span by @sylvesterkaczmarek in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4496 * fix(tracing): clean up processors after tracing is disabled by @sylvesterkaczmarek in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4502 * fix(visualization): expand handoff() targets in agent graphs by @hsusul in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4517 ### Documentation & Other Changes * docs: document v0.21.1 runtime behavior by @seratch in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4460 * docs: correct Agent.clone list attribute semantics by @thegoodengineer in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4474 * docs: add testing resources to llms indexes by @teachershuang in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4509 * ci: align Python version coverage by @seratch in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4475 * test: use sys.executable instead of tee for the stdio placeholder command by @ErenAta16 in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4478 * fix: keep Codex verification for development sandboxed by @seratch in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4508 com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4516 * release: 0.22.0 by @seratch in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4523 ## New Contributors * @li2631026381-alt made their first contribution in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4470 * @thegoodengineer made their first contribution in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4474 * @teachershuang made their first contribution in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4509 * @weike-zhang made their first contribution in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4516 * @chiruu12 made their first contribution in https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/4479 **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/compare/v0.21.1...v0.22.0

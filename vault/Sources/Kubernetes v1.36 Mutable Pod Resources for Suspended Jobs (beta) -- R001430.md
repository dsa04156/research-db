## 요약·초록

Kubernetes v1.36 promotes the ability to modify container resource requests and limits in the pod template of a suspended Job to beta. First introduced as alpha in v1.35, this feature allows queue controllers and cluster administrators to adjust CPU, memory, GPU, and extended resource specifications on a Job while it is suspended, before it starts or resumes running. Why mutable pod resources for suspended Jobs? Batch and machine learning workloads often have resource requirements that are not precisely known at Job creation time. The optimal resource allocation depends on current cluster capacity, queue priorities, and the availability of specialized hardware like GPUs. Before this feature, resource requirements in a Job's pod template were immutable once set. If a queue controller like Kueue determined that a suspended Job should run with different resources, the only option was to delete and recreate the Job, losing any associated metadata, status, or history. This feature also provides a way to let a specific Job instance for a CronJob progress slowly with reduced resources, rather than outright failing to run if the cluster is heavily loaded. Consider a machine learning training Job initially requesting 4 GPUs: apiVersion : batch/v1 kind : Job metadata : name : training-job-example-abcd123 labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : trainer spec : suspend : true template : metadata : annotations : kubernetes.io/description : "ML training, ID abcd123" spec : containers : - name : trainer image : example-registry.example.com/training:2026-04-23T150405.678 resources : requests : cpu : "8" memory : "32Gi" example-hardware-vendor.com/gpu : "4" limits : cpu : "8" memory : "32Gi" example-hardware-vendor.com/gpu : "4" restartPolicy : Never A queue controller managing cluster resources might determine that only 2 GPUs are available. With this feature, the controller can update the Job's resource requests before resuming it: apiVersion : batch/v1 kind : Job metadata : name : training-job-example-abcd123 labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : trainer spec : suspend : true template : metadata : annotations : kubernetes.io/description : "ML training, ID abcd123" spec : containers : - name : trainer image : example-registry.example.com/training:2026-04-23T150405.678 resources : requests : cpu : "4" memory : "16Gi" example-hardware-vendor.com/gpu : "2" limits : cpu : "4" memory : "16Gi" example-hardware-vendor.com/gpu : "2" restartPolicy : Never Once the resources are updated, the controller resumes the Job by setting spec.suspend to false , and the new Pods are created with the adjusted resource specifications. How it works The Kubernetes API server relaxes the immutability constraint on pod template resource fields specifically for suspended Jobs. No new API types have been introduced; the existing Job and pod template structures accommodate the change through relaxed validation. The mutable fields are: spec.template.spec.containers[*].resources.requests spec.template.spec.containers[*].resources.limits spec.template.spec.initContainers[*].resources.requests spec.template.spec.initContainers[*].resources.limits Resource updates are permitted when the following conditions are met: The Job has spec.suspend set to true . For a Job that was previously running and then suspended, all active Pods must have terminated ( status.active equals 0) before resource mutations are accepted. Standard resource validation still applies. For example, resource limits must be greater than or equal to requests, and extended resources must be specified as whole numbers where required. What's new in beta With the promotion to beta in Kubernetes v1.36, the MutablePodResourcesForSuspendedJobs feature gate is enabled by default. This means clusters running v1.36 can use this feature without any additional configuration on the API server. Try it out If your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.36 or later, this feature is available by default. For v1.35 clusters, enable the MutablePodResourcesForSuspendedJobs feature gate on the kube-apiserver . You can test it by creating a suspended Job, updating its container resources using kubectl edit or a controller, and then resuming the Job: # Create a suspended Job kubectl apply -f my-job.yaml --server-side # Edit the resource requests kubectl edit job training-job-example-abcd123 # Resume the Job kubectl patch job training-job-example-abcd123 -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}' Considerations Running Jobs that are suspended If you suspend a Job that was already running, you must wait for all of that Job's active Pods to terminate before modifying resources. The API server rejects resource mutations while status.active is greater than zero. This prevents inconsistency between running Pods and the updated pod template. Pod replacement policy When using this feature with Jobs that may have failed Pods, consider setting podReplacementPolicy: Failed . This ensures that replacement Pods are only created after the previous Pods have fully terminated, preventing resource contention from overlapping Pods. ResourceClaims Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) resourceClaimTemplates remain immutable. If your workload uses DRA, you must recreate the claim templates separately to match any resource changes. Getting involved This feature was developed by SIG Apps This feature was developed by SIG Apps with input from WG Batch . Both groups welcome feedback as the feature progresses toward stable.
